This is a project for writing and searching on a binary file. We explain this with three examples.


First Example(Indexed items):

In this example we basically we add items to a dictionary and in a way index
them as 0,1,2...
	eg(expected output): {0: item1, 1: item2...}


Second Example(Very Important Records):

This is another one of many ways that a user might use binary file for. It's
similar to a database of student details(we are using only name and roll no as
an example for simplicity).
	eg(expected output):{Name: student1, Roll no.:STD1}
			    {Name: student2, Roll no.:STD2}
			    .
			    .
			    .


Third Example(Searching For Very Important Details):

This block of code is an example of searching in a binary file. Here, we
search for student's records by name or view the entire database.
	eg(expected output): {Name: student1, Roll no.:STD1}      #if student1 is searched.


Note- You might happen to notice one more block of code. If you do, we expect you to be very heartless and ignore it.
